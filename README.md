Why this project exists
Dabt emerges from a need to deliver a polished, gift-like online edition that looks like a manuscript while benefiting from modern web tooling. It is not a huge CMS. It is a compact, well-engineered platform that can host a personal zine, a small portfolio, or a curated collection of writings in a readable and accessible format. The manuscript styling is more than a theme; it is a guiding principle for typography, spacing, rhythm, and typographic hierarchy. The project aims to be pleasant to work with, easy to extend, and robust for publishing workflows.
